# Simple Compiler

Implementation of language examples in [this course](https://bobzhang.github.io/courses/)

There are several folders in this repo:

1. OCaml: OCaml implementation, but not well-implemented.
2. C++: C++ implementation. The code implementation is in line with my course progress. Plan to use lexer and yacc to do more things.
3. coqProof: trivial proof. Just for fun.
